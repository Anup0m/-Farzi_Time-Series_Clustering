## Objective of the Project
Cluster and visualize time-series data, such as stock prices or temperature trends, using clustering algorithms.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Data Source(s)
Synthetic data is generated for the purpose of this project. Replace with actual stock prices or temperature trends as needed.

## Execution Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.
3. Ensure all required libraries are installed.

## Project Code
The code provided in the Jupyter Notebook performs the following tasks:
1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Loads and visualizes the time-series data.
3. Preprocesses the data by standardizing it.
4. Applies K-means clustering to group similar time-series data.
5. Evaluates clustering performance using silhouette score.
6. Visualizes the clustered time-series data.

## Summary of Results
The synthetic time-series data was clustered into two groups using K-means clustering. The silhouette score indicates the quality of the clustering. Visualizations show the original time-series data and the clustered groups.

## Challenges Faced
- Generating realistic synthetic data.
- Deciding on the appropriate number of clusters for K-means.
- Interpreting the clustering results and visualizations.
